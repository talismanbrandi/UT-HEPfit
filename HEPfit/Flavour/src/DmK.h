 * @brief A class for @f$\Delta M_K@f$, the difference in mass
 * of between the heavy and light mass eigenstates of the neutral
 * Kaon system.
 * @author HEPfit Collaboration
 * @copyright GNU General Public License
 * @details This class is used to compute the theoretical value of
 * @f$\Delta M_K@f$. While the short distance contributions to this 
 * parameter is calculable both in the SM and in NP models, the long distance
 * contribution can only be estimated and might contribute to as much as half the
 * value of the parameter. This long distance contribution is put in as an
 * input parameter in this code through SM.getDMK().
