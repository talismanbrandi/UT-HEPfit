HEPfit - a Fitting Tool for the Standard Model and Beyond
===================================================================

version core-1.0
-----------

HEPfit is a flexible tool which, given the Standard Model or any extension,
allows to:

  - fit the model parameters to a given set of experimental observables
  - obtain fit results for observables
  - obtain predictions for observables

The HEPfit library can be used:

  - to perform a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of the implemented model using BAT support
  - to perform a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of user defined models and/or observables using BAT support
  - to perform a user defined statistical analysis with the models and observables implemented in the library
  - to perform a user defined statistical analysis with user defined models and/or observables

The Markov Chain Monte Carlo is based on the [BAT (Bayesian Analysis Toolkit) library](https://www.mppmu.mpg.de/bat/).
